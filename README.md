# MJML Boilerplate

We love creating beautfiul newsletters and have been doing it for a while now.
Our work has been featured on Really Good Emails: https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/getting-the-most-out-of-mindnode-for-ios-3-3/
Here is a demo we put together to show the power of MJML: https://anwert-io.github.io/anwert-mjml-boilerplate/dist/

To create such good looking newsletters we utilize two tools:
1. [MJML](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml)
2. This boilerplate

## Usage

**Installation**
`
# Clone the repo to your 
git clone https://github.com/anwert-io/anwert-mjml-boilerplate.git <YOUR PROJECT NAME>
cd <YOUR PROJECT NAME>
# Install dependencies
npm install
`

That's it, you can now remove our demo project files and add your own. 

**Watch:**
`npm run watch`

Running the watch command will launch [BrowserSync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync). BrowserSync will reload your site automatically when you change the code and push those changes onto any you are testing on. No further setup needed. 

**Build**
`npm run build`

## Future features
