# MJML Boilerplate
Made with â™¡ by [Anwert](https://anwert.io/) in Vienna.


We love creating beautfiul newsletters and have been doing it for a while now. Our work has been featured on [Really Good Emails](https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/getting-the-most-out-of-mindnode-for-ios-3-3/) as well as countless of email inboxes around the world.

To do our part in improving newsletters everywhere we decided to open-source our MJML based toolchain.

[Here is a demo we made to show what layouts are possible with MJML](https://anwert-io.github.io/anwert-mjml-boilerplate/dist/index.html) to show the power of MJML.

## What the boilerplate does
The boilerplate provides you with the following:
* A (configureable) project structure
* BrowserSync for live reloading and simultaneous multi-device testing
* Automatic image optimization

## Usage

**Installation**

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anwert-io/anwert-mjml-boilerplate.git <YOUR PROJECT NAME>

cd <YOUR PROJECT NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

That's it, you can now remove our demo project files and add your own. 

**Watch:**
```
npm run watch
```

Running the watch command will launch [BrowserSync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync). BrowserSync will reload your site automatically when you change the code and push those changes onto any you are testing on. No further setup needed. 

**Build**
```
npm run build
```

## Future features
* Multilingual support
